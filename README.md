FROGGER GAME CLONE || by Udacity and Tiffany Han
=====================================================================================

THE GOAL:
	- get to the water before the bugs get to you!


HOW TO PLAY:
	- open index.html to load the game
	- use the arrows keys to move your character
	- getting hit by a bug means you have to start over
	- when you get to the water you've won, and your character
	  resets back to the starting position
